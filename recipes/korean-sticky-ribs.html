            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Kg Baby Back pork ribs</li>
                <li>4 Bay leaves</li>
                <li>5 tblsp Mirin</li>
                <li>Ginger</li>
                <li>3 tblsp Strawberry Jam</li>
                <li>3 tblsp Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>1/4th of a cup Apple juice</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p> Before we can braise the ribs in its sticky sauce, we need to Blance them and take the porky smell from them.
                please don't skip this part. Now if You have Doenjang you may use this instead of the Mirin, Bayleaves and 
                ginger. But if you dont have, nor want to buy, doenjang you will be fine with Mirin, Bayleaves and Ginger.

                            that you have the following look: meat and bone then cut.

                        <p>In a pot add Water (just enough so it will later cover the ribs), 4 Bayleaves, 3 tbls Mirin and 
                            a big piece of ginger slied (no need to peel) and then slightly opened with the back of your
                            knife. Let that boil for 5 minutes to infuse the flavor.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Add the ribs to the boiling water and cook for 10 minutes. Take off the scum that flows up with a spoon or 
                            laddle. Once the time is up, drain the ribs and set aside.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Braising marinade</h4>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            For the marinade mix Jame, Soy Sauce, remaining Mirin (2 tblsp), garlic, Applejuice and pepper
                            in a large enough bowl and mix until the jam is well incorporated.

                    </li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Braising the Ribs</h4>
                <ol start="5">
                    <li>
                        <p>Get a large pan, add some oil and let it warm over medium high heat. Dont make this too hot
                            or the soy sauce will burn! Make sure you have a lid for this pan.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once the pan is well warmed on low to medium high heat, add the ribs on the meat side. Then its time to add 
                            2/3rds of the sauce to the pan. Cover and let it cook for about 5 minutes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After 5 minutes, open the lid and flip all ribs. Cover again and repeat the step for about 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After the time is up, open the lid and check if the sauce has thickened. If not, turn the ribs again and repeat Step 5. 
                            If the sauce has thickened turn the ribs and add the remaining sauce to the pan. Watch until the sauce thickens and
                            throws big bubbles, then take out the ribs and plate.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <p> And you are done! I hope you enjoy them just as much as my family!</p>
            <p>Now these are best served with hot steaming rice, browned onions and some kimchi to cut through the pork fat.</p>
