            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>First 30 minutes before you boil the eggs, take them out of the fridge so they aren't cold anylonger. 
                        poke a hole in the top off the eggs with a pin needle. Put a large pot on the stove and bring watering
                        to a rolling boil.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the eggs to the boiling water and set a timer for 10 minutes. If the water stopped boiling then 
                        add a minute to the timer. After the timer runs out put the eggs in a bowl with icecold water. Once they have cooled
                        peel them and then take an egg cutter and cut them length wise, turn them 90 degrees in the cutter and then cut them
                        once more to cut dices.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>to the eggs add 1/4th of a cup of mayonaise, 2 teaspoons mustard, chives and salt and pepper. Mix
                    and keep testing and adding salt and pepper until you like the taste.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p>And thats pretty much it! So enjoy!</p>
